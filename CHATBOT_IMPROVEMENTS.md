# Chatbot Improvements - Quota Handling & Fallback System

## Overview

The chatbot has been enhanced to handle API quota limitations and provide better user experience when the AI service is temporarily unavailable.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Quota Exceeded Handling (429 Errors)
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects when the Gemini API quota is exceeded
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Provides helpful responses even when AI is unavailable
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear communication about service limitations

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- **Smart Retries**: Automatically retries failed requests with increasing delays
- **Rate Limit Respect**: Only retries on appropriate error codes (429, 503)
- **Configurable**: Adjustable retry attempts and delay intervals

### 3. Intelligent Fallback Responses
- **Context-Aware**: Provides relevant answers based on user questions
- **Common Topics Covered**:
  - Login and authentication issues
  - Course materials and modules
  - Assignments and homework
  - Progress tracking and grades
  - Help and support
  - Schedule and classes
  - Account management
  - Payment and enrollment
  - Instructor communication
  - Projects and coding

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues to provide value even when AI is down
- **Better User Experience**: No more confusing error messages
- **Helpful Guidance**: Directs users to appropriate resources

## Technical Implementation

### API Route (`app/api/chatbot/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Retry logic with exponential backoff
async function retryWithBackoff<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  baseDelay: number = 1000
): Promise<T>

// Intelligent fallback response generation
function generateFallbackResponse(message: string, pageContext?: string): string
```

### Chatbot Component (`components/Chatbot.tsx`)
- Enhanced error handling for quota exceeded scenarios
- Better fallback message display
- Improved user experience during service interruptions

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Chatbot continues to provide value even when AI service is down
2. **User Experience**: Clear, helpful responses instead of technical errors
3. **Cost Management**: Handles quota limitations gracefully
4. **Scalability**: Retry logic helps with temporary service issues

## Usage

The chatbot now automatically:
- Detects quota exceeded errors
- Provides relevant fallback responses
- Retries failed requests intelligently
- Maintains conversation flow

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Set your own Gemini API key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```
